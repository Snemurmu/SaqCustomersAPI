This is a SAQ Customer repository implementation. This has been tested on a Windows machine using PowerShell in the Visual Studio Code 1.74.2

To build the maven project use the following command.

$ mvn clean install

$ java -jar .\target\SaqCustomersAPI-1.0.jar

Then enter each customer using the following format :

$ sav John Mack 30
  sav Nancy Wilson 32
  list
  
The last command 'list' will exit the program. You can enter as many customers as you want. 

Please see the screenshot.
